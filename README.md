## 🚀 **What is Edupay?**

Edupay is a payment platform that helps schools, colleges, and universities accept stablecoin payments. Built for the **EDU Chain Hackathon**, our solution runs on EDU Chain's testnet, making school payments faster, cheaper, and available to everyone.

Stablecoins are digital currencies with steady value (like digital dollars), so schools don't have to worry about price swings that happen with other cryptocurrencies.

## 🎯 **The Problems We Solve**

School payment systems today have many issues:

| **Problem** | **How It Affects You** | **Our Solution** |
|:------------|:------------------------|:-----------------|
| **Slow International Payments** | Students wait days for payments to clear | Payments complete in minutes on EDU Chain |
| **High Processing Fees** | Schools lose 2-5% on each transaction | Cut fees by up to 80% using stablecoins |
| **Manual Payment Tracking** | Staff waste time matching payments to students | Automatic payment tracking and matching |
| **Limited Global Access** | Some payment methods don't work everywhere | Anyone with internet can pay from anywhere |
| **Exchange Rate Problems** | Currency conversions create unexpected costs | Stablecoins keep their value consistently |
